# Deployment of hello world application
 
## Context
 ##### Deployment of hello world application through the CI/CD Pipeline with implementation of security
 
## Tools
   
- Cloud: GCP, (vm, gke, service account)
- Container Engine: Docker
- Source Code Management: Github
- Scheduling: Jenkins
- Security: Snyk, Sonarqube
- Notification: Slack
- gcloud

## Infrastructure

  We wanted to reproduce an enterprise-type infrastructure with 3 servers and GKE
  
 - A master server Jenkins scheduling build jobs, monitor the slaves
 - A build server(slave) to build our docker images, tests, and  scan  images
 - Google Kubernetes engine to deploy our web application which can be consumed of production.
 - Sonarqube server: Static Code Analysis
 - Snyk: scan docker images

## Choice and description of tools

- Terraform  infrastructure as code tool used to automate infrastructure in cloud provider. it will help to prvision 3 servers(jenkins,nodebuild and sonarqube) and Google kubernetes Engine
- Jenkins is an open-source automation server that facilitates continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) of software projects. It enables developers to 
   automate various stages of the software development lifecycle, including building, testing, and deploying applications
- Using Docker to containerize hello world application
- Dockerhub: registry to store docker imges
- Snyk is a popular developer-first security platform that helps developers find and fix vulnerabilities in their open-source dependencies and container images.Here are 
  some key
    1. Dependency scanning
    2. Container image scanning
    3. Fix suggestions and remediation
- GKE used to deploy hello world application
- Slack collaborative platform used to notify us of the state of the pipeline
- SonarQube is an open-source platform developed by SonarSource for continuous inspection of code quality. SonarQube does static code analysis, which provides a detailed 
  report of bugs, code smells, vulnerabilities, code duplications.

## Installation tools
- Install Terraform on Windows or linux:  https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
- Installer SDK Cloud:  https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
- Create Google account: https://cloud.google.com/docs/get-started 
- Create un service account on GCP: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create
- install jenkins  https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/
- install sonarqube https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/setup-and-upgrade/install-the-server/
- create snyk account https://snyk.io/
- Create dockerhub account: https://hub.docker.com/

##### NB: After creating a service account, you will download a .json file necessary for any application (terraform, Gcloud) connected to your account to deploy the resources and in google cloud platform, we create a project, enable the bill, link to that project and whatever we want to create, we need to enable the API(enable API for compute engine, kubernetes engine etc)
##### Using terraform to provision resource in GCP compute network, subnetwork, firewall and two compute instances
##### Automate infrastructure with terraform (Jenkins and sonarqube server, gke) the code is here  https://github.com/carolledevops/Helloworld.git
We provide service account to terraforn, it use that to authenticate to gcp and provision infrastructure

## Connection of tools

we need to connect the tools 
- after installing the tools, we need to connect
- jenkins: ip:8080
- sonarqube: ip:9000.

jenkins to authenticate or communicate with tools, we need to integre plugins(jenkins is collection of plugin) and provide credentials of each tools.
Plugins that we need to integrate( sonarqube scanner, slack notification, docker, snyk security plugin, gke plugin, github integration, kubernetes etc) 
## manage jenkins - plugins - available plugins and integrate the plugins that we need
### Now we need to generate token
# sonarqube 
    go to  account - security - generate token
# snyk 
 we need to generate token: 
 #### account setting

# slack( generate token)
after create your account, you provide your workspace my workspace here is devops and that workspace, create your channel mine is #develop
 on devops, you select 
#####  Settings & administration - manage app

## Workflow
CI/CD pipeleine, we have 4 environments(dev, qa, prepro,pro) and each environment have the pipeline 
- In dev environment, we have multipipeline, I will use one pipeline
![Screenshot (353)](https://github.com/carolledevops/Helloworld/assets/138341326/135317d6-57d2-4b5a-a134-1c9d7af84761)
### Explication
##### Development pipeline (when pull request merged to develop branch)

1.  A pull request is merged in the develop branch
2.  jenkins notice the change on helloworld repository via preset webhook then clone the repository.
3.  Jenkins send build start notification on slack
4,5 jenkins use the docker agent to launch sonarqube scannercli container to analyse the code and the scan result sent back to jenkins
6.  Jenkins sent the build report to sonarqube to be compared with quality gate
7.  sonarqube sent the code analysis result back to jenkins
8.  jenkins read dockerfile to build, scan and push docker images to dockerhub
9.  jenkins deploy helloworld application in kubernetes
10. kubernetes pull docker images from dockerhub

##### QA pipeline

![Screenshot (354)](https://github.com/carolledevops/Helloworld/assets/138341326/8856a655-93d8-4882-8a86-693eb9edbca3)

pipeline for qa will capable to take as input  docker image and perform differents test(load test, functional test etc)

##### Production pipeline 

![Screenshot (356)](https://github.com/carolledevops/Helloworld/assets/138341326/7717f3b5-320c-49ed-a1ba-402097ce1c24)

 - After validation by the whole team, the Ops manager can make the merger request in order to pass the modification on the main branch.
 - Deployment in production environment will then be activated and a notification is sent to slack
 - Once the application is deployed Kubernetes cluster, a end user will be able to connect and consume the application.
